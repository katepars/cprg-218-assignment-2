            <h2>Big Four Roadhouse</h2>
            <img src="bigfour.jpg">
            <p>The Big Four Roadhouse got it's name from Calgarys “Big Four” businessmen and ranchers A.E. Cross, Pat Burns, George Lane and A.J. Maclean, provided financial backing to Guy Weadick’s Frontier Days and Cowboy Championship Contest, which would soon become the Stampede. Built at a cost of about $2 million, the 118,000 square feet of space over two levels contained 24 sheets of ice on the lower level, which was subsequently doubled in 1960, forming what was, at the time, the largest curling rink in the world. The building officially opened in 1958.  The ice on the lower level was eventually removed in the lead-up to the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. As time went on the building faced talk of replacement and the need for repairs after the flood in 2013 damaged the lower level. Now however it has had many upgrades and is a well sought after building for hosting events. (Source:Onewestevents)  </p>

                <h2>Stampede Corall</h2>
                <img src="Corral.jpg">
                <p>Designed by architect John Stevenson and built in 1950, the Corral is one of the oldest structures in Stampede Park and was constructed on the grounds where the old Industrial building once stood. Early names for the corral included the “Rodeodrome” and the “Stampedeoriem. The Stampede Corral opened in 1950 letting Calgarians see the largest new arena west of Toronto for an admission of only 55 cents. the Corral would go on to host NHL games, along with the world-famous Stampede Wrestling and Cirque du Soleil. An eclectic array of top entertainers such as Johnny Cash, Bob Hope, Chuck Berry, The Three Stooges, The Who, Rihanna and Queen — headed up by the legendary Freddie Mercury — also graced the stage of its 6,650-seat facility with standing room for 2,200. Today what remains of the Corral includes murals of Cappy Smart, Guy Weadick and the RCMP Musical Ride, preserved using laser imaging, for future replication at the park. The Neon Cowboy sign, along with the figurines of hockey players and other athletes — which were affixed to several feet of thick concrete — were also digitized so that they can later be recreated and brought back to life, likely in and around the new convention centre.

                <h2>Victoria Pavillion</h2>
                <img src="760802.jpg">
                <p>Today the Victoria Paviliion is known on stampede grounds at the Agriculture Building. Built in after the first world war in 1919 the Victoria Pavilion serves as a cattle pavilion and curling rink, and is the oldest building on the grounds. It’s architecture is of a utilitarian style, though both it and the adjacent Administration building are now covered with a metal facade. (Source:avenuecalgary) </p>

                <h2>Saddledome</h2>
                <img src="dome.jpg">
                <p>Completed in 1983, the Saddledome replaced the Corral as the home for both the Calgary Flames and the main Olympic venue for the 1988 winter Olympics. Built at a cost of $97.7 million, the Saddledome can seat more than 20,000 people. The Saddledome Foundation was established to oversee construction and future management of the new facility. Quick progress was made, and on October 15, 1983, the doors to the Saddledome officially opened. During the 1988 Olympic Winter Games, the Saddledome was a star attraction, successfully hosting the figure skating and hockey competitions. In 1994, management of the Saddledome was transferred to the newly formed Calgary Flames Limited Partnership. In the fall of that year, renovations totalling more than $37 million were undertaken. One year later, the new Scotiabank Saddledome was unveiled.(Source:scotiabanksaddledome.com)</p>
